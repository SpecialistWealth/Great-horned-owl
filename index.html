<p>The <b>Great Horned Owl</b> (<i>Bubo virginianus</i>), also known as the tiger owl (originally derived from early naturalists' description as the "winged tiger" or "tiger of the air")[3] or the hoot owl,[4] is a large owl native to the Americas. It is an extremely adaptable bird with a vast range and is the most widely distributed true owl in the Americas.[5] Its primary diet is rabbits and hares, rats and mice, and voles, although it freely hunts any animal it can overtake, including rodents and other small mammals, larger mid-sized mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates.</p>
